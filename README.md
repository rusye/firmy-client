# Znayti Client Side

Znayti will help Russian speaking users locate businesses that have so that they will be able to communicate in a language that they understand easier.

## Motivation

When ever I'm trying to find a business that can do the same job cheaper I sometimes turn to the Russian speaking community, but trying to locate the right business is a little hard because most of it is word of mouth.

## Description

You will be able to select the general area your searching for by city name or zip code and it will return all businesses in that area.
